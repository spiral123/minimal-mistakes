================

## This privacy policy relates to the following apps: BestRoute Free, BestRoute Pro and BestRoute Beta.

**Summary:** our apps do not keep any uniquely identifiable information about you.  Apart from the route you are currently using the app does not store any of your address information.  Archived routes are stored in your own cloud-based Google drive account.

None of your information is transmitted or stored on our servers or to third parties other than as described below.

### Your Google Account
BestRoute asks you to log in with your Google account in order to store your routes in the cloud.  Your routes are stored in your Google Drive.  You can access them here (warning: edits that you make here may affect the ability of the app to read your routes!).

Account registration is managed through Google services and the data is stored in your own account: we do not keep or copy any of your data.

### Advertising
We use the Google AdMob service to provide advertising for the Free version of our app.

AdMob uses a unique advertising id to serve personalized ads based on the your interests (which includes collecting and analyzing user data, including current location).  If you do not wish to see this form of advertising then please upgrade to the Pro version of the app or uninstall the Free version.

We do not capture or record any information sent to AdMob, including your current location.
